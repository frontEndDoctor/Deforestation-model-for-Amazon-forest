#Deforestation-model-for-Amazon-forest

HDSC_STAGE_D_QUIZ

This is my first attempt on a Kaggle competition


In this repo is contained a ipynb file of the codes used in building a model to predict the numan footprint path in the Amazon forest with respect to deforestation.


It also contains screenshots of my scores in the competition.

I'm grateful to Hamoye AI Labs for this technical but awesome experience through the HDSC 2020

I hope to tune the model later on in the nearest future to achieve a better prediction score.
